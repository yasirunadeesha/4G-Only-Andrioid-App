# 4G-Only-Andrioid-App
4G Only is a lightweight Android app that quickly opens the hidden Phone Information screen, letting you set LTE-only (4G only) or NR-only (5G only) modes. It doesn’t change radio settings directly—just gives fast access. Features a simple Material UI, clear instructions, and handles blocked or missing pages gracefully.
